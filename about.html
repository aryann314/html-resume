<h1>About Aryan</h1>
<p>My name is Aryan Sharma. At the time of writing this, I am 18 years old. I am highly ambitious and dream of reaching great heights. I am passionate about cinema and find myself addicted to it. In movies and series, I admire how the protagonist never loses hope and finds himself amidst all the chaos in their life. I aspire to find myself and discover my capabilities before becoming someone my parents are proud of. Alongside cinema, I also enjoy anime and consider myself a weeb and a cinephile. I have spent a lot of time binge-watching and have seen the shine that every protagonist holds in their eyes - the shine of being happy and free. That is what I want for myself.
</p>

<p>What I have achieved till now:
  I have completed my high school, which in India is 12th CBSE boards, with 73%. It's not exactly what I had hoped for, but I'm not sad about it because I have never regretted the time I spent in my years of school life. I don't know much about programming, but I'm trying to learn and adapt. I know a little bit of Python and I am currently learning the HTML language.

<p>My Goals :
  1. To make my parents proud above everything else because why not?!
  2. To be free and independent.
  3. To keep on learning new stuff and to keep up with the pace of the world.
  4. To find myself and the meaning in life.
  5. To earn money because I want the luxury to buy anything I fancy.
